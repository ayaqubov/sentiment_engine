Blast01_0,Blast01,0,44,-0.2,I had been looking to get into the speak-your-command speaker game for a while but was unsure of what I would like to go with but ultimately when the opportunity came to get the UE Blast with Alexa I jumped at the chance.,English
Blast01_1,Blast01,1,35,0.125,While I had some experience with issuing commands to my Xbox I knew the experience of using Alexa was much better since I had set them up as gifts for relatives in the past.,English
Blast01_2,Blast01,2,16,0.0,When I received the UE Blast it was nearly fully charged and had minimal packaging.,English
Blast01_3,Blast01,3,24,0.294444444444,It was ready to go out of the box but I did have to download and configure the app which was pretty easy.,English
Blast01_4,Blast01,4,23,0.2,After linking it to my account on Amazon and establishing a bluetooth and wifi connection I was ready to test it out.,English
Blast01_5,Blast01,5,32,0.0,"The speaker itself is quite similar in design to another speaker that my wife and I had been using for a couple of years now, that is the UE Boom.",English
Blast01_6,Blast01,6,8,0.3,It's bigger and has better sound.,English
Blast01_7,Blast01,7,42,0.361767676768,"I knew that our experience with the UE Boom had been a positive one, the speaker held a charge a long time, was easy to pair and had excellent sound so I held high hopes for the UE Blast.",English
Blast01_8,Blast01,8,17,0.563333333333,Once everything was configured the UE Blast was very easy to use by issuing Alexa commands.,English
Blast01_9,Blast01,9,56,0.428571428571,"The toughest part is remembering the best way to address the commands, although it should be noted that Alexa doesn't require rote, specific type of commands (as the Xbox does) but through practice my wife and I have found out that it does respond to certain phrasings better than others.",English
Blast01_10,Blast01,10,30,-0.0833333333333,"You also have to learn to add a slight pause after saying ""Alexa"" and not just start yelling out commands but that becomes second nature in practice.",English
Blast01_11,Blast01,11,32,-0.25,"I was highly disappointed to see that Alexa could not control Spotify and that Spotify would only work when using a Bluetooth command, similar in nature to the UE Boom.",English
Blast01_12,Blast01,12,26,0.4,Spotify is my primary music source and I do not like that Amazon seems to want to steer you to their Amazon Prime Music direction.,English
Blast01_13,Blast01,13,46,0.366666666667,"However, it should be noted that you do not have to be a subscriber to the Amazon music service to use Alexa on this device, but it will open up more music, including your own if you have a subscription to it.",English
Blast01_14,Blast01,14,43,-0.1,"I have used the speaker twice now in long sessions and the first session I got about 7 hours out of moderate listening levels which was, in my opinion, disappointing considering the speaker promises ""up to 12 hours"".",English
Blast01_15,Blast01,15,30,-0.0833333333333,"We all know ""up to"" is the key there but still, roughly half of the promised amount is not what I'd consider a home run.",English
Blast01_16,Blast01,16,28,0.15,The second time listening from a full charge we got roughly 9 hours and that is listening at moderate listening levels so that was a bit better.,English
Blast01_17,Blast01,17,16,0.316666666667,It honestly made me wonder if the first I was not at a complete charge.,English
Blast01_18,Blast01,18,58,0.125,"It should be noted here that the only way to know the charge level of the speaker is through the app and you will only know two levels of charge, full charge or partial charge and that is a sincere lack of information in my opinion that needs updated with a future fix for the app.",English
Blast01_19,Blast01,19,25,0.305571428571,The quality of the sound of the speaker is very high for a large room and the speaker will fill the room with sound.,English
Blast01_20,Blast01,20,29,0.238095238095,Any larger than a large room though and the speaker will struggle but for most people volume or clarity of the music will not be any issue whatsoever.,English
Blast01_21,Blast01,21,29,-0.55,"It was disappointing that I was unable to band my UE Blast to my UE Boom to create a stereo, or mirror, effect from one source.",English
Blast01_22,Blast01,22,20,0.0,I worked on this for well over an hour before looking online and determining it simply is not possible.,English
Blast01_23,Blast01,23,43,0.65,"So word to the wise, if you already own a UE product and are considering buying this to add on as a ""stereo"" effect or even just a multi-room, one source solution you will be out of luck.",English
Blast01_24,Blast01,24,27,0.2,It remains to be seen if this will be fixed in a future update but I sincerely doubt that it will happen based upon my research.,English
Blast01_25,Blast01,25,25,0.285333333333,"Ultimately I do recommend this device, it's very clear, very loud, integrates Alexa commands perfectly and has decent battery life.",English
Blast01_26,Blast01,26,37,0.316666666667,"Just be aware though that it won't control Spotify via Alexa, the battery life is not what is promised (but still good overall) and it will not pair with another UE device.",English
Blast01_27,Blast01,27,8,0.0,Another downside of course is the price.,English
Blast01_28,Blast01,28,28,0.35,I am not completely sure this is a great value for most people but I will say if you have the money the device will not disappoint.,English
Blast01_29,Blast01,29,25,0.277777777778,For most people on a budget this would be a better value purchase on sale or at a discounted rate perhaps on Black Friday.,English
Blast01_30,Blast01,30,17,0.325,There are certainly more reasonably priced devices that will do many of what this speaker offers.,English
Blast01_31,Blast01,31,37,0.433333333333,"But if you want a great all-in-one solution, are aware of some of the limitations of the device and its app and are willing to pay the money you cannot beat the UE Blast.",English
Blast02_0,Blast02,0,12,0.3,Just got my blast today and I love it so far.,English
Blast02_1,Blast02,1,17,0.383333333333,"Connecting it to the Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Alexa were all super easy through the App.",English
Blast02_2,Blast02,2,11,0.733333333333,The sound quality is excellent and Wi-FI/Bluetooth range is great.,English
Blast02_3,Blast02,3,29,-0.3,The one negative thing that I've noticed is that you can no longer turn it on using the App which you can do on the Boom 2.,English
Blast02_4,Blast02,4,12,0.0,Hopefully that will be an added feature in a future update.,English
Blast03_0,Blast03,0,33,0.166666666667,"Although there may be a way to set ""Alexa"" up with the older Boom and Mega Boom apps that you have on your phone or tablet; don't try.",English
Blast03_1,Blast03,1,14,0.0,START by finding the Ultimate Ears BLUE SQUARE app in your app store.,English
Blast03_2,Blast03,2,15,0.0,"If you have difficulty ""updating"" the speaker, try a sleepy hour.",English
Blast03_3,Blast03,3,4,0.0,Works well then.,English
Blast03_4,Blast03,4,8,0.0,Seems the UE server has been overwhelmed.,English
Blast03_5,Blast03,5,40,0.1,"I have found 2 snags so far that make it not like a ""Fancy ECHO""--

1) You have to tap to wake Alexa up after a time out period, like a night's sleep.",English
Blast03_6,Blast03,6,13,0.0,"You just cant say, ""Alexa what time is it?""",English
Blast03_7,Blast03,7,10,0.0,2) It seems Sirius XM is not supported.,English
Blast03_8,Blast03,8,19,0.0,I even deleted the link association from my Echo and reconnected and it can't be picked up.,English
Blast03_9,Blast03,9,15,0.0,HOWEVER I still can link it with the BLAST through Bluetooth and my phone.,English
Blast03_10,Blast03,10,12,0.0,"Just no ""Alexa, play Sirius XM""

Blast03_11,Blast03,11,17,0.0,After you Bluetooth in you have to remember to cut the Bluetooth connection to get Alexa back,English
Blast04_0,Blast04,0,59,0.215925925926,"Ears is a mixed bag in comparison to similar items

Pros:
Highly portable: it's light and easy to carry in the hand, has a small footprint

Easy set-up: It paired easily with my iPhone, and setting up the wi-fi connection and then the connection to my Amazon account was quick and painless.",English
Blast04_1,Blast04,1,49,0.21,"Took no more than a minute or two

Alexa: This is my only Alexa device, so I can't say how it does in comparison to others, but it's so far been mostly (more on that in the cons) a good experience.",English
Blast04_2,Blast04,2,23,0.125,"It's responsive, and rarely requires a repeat of any given command so long as I'm within about 10 feet.",English
Blast04_3,Blast04,3,79,0.12619047619,"Farther than that and I need to really speak up and occasionally repeat myself, but only once typically, not four or five times

Waterproof: I confess I haven't tested this, so I'm just going with the product description, but it's a nice feature to have for such a portable speaker

Cons
Wi-fi connectivity: While set-up was a breeze, I've had several issue with it momentarily dropping wi-fi.",English
Blast04_4,Blast04,4,15,0.0416666666667,The first time I listened for half an hour and it dropped wi-fi once.,English
Blast04_5,Blast04,5,23,0.0,"The second time, it dropped wi-fi repeatedly, not once getting through an entire song in about 20-30 minutes of listening.",English
Blast04_6,Blast04,6,21,-0.0555555555556,"The third time, also about half an hour, fell somewhere in the middle, dropping wi-fi three times.",English
Blast04_7,Blast04,7,20,-0.1,"It's a momentary drop--about a 2-3 second pause, but it's sure an annoying one.",English
Blast04_8,Blast04,8,39,0.146428571429,"If things change I'll update, but if this stays an issue I'll certainly not be using this even though I like the Alexa aspect

Sound: I'd put this somewhere between Pro and Con.",English
Blast04_9,Blast04,9,15,0.040625,"It's not bad sound at all, but it's a little thin.",English
Blast04_10,Blast04,10,19,0.21,I also have a Jam Heavy Metal and the sound on that is definitely richer and more full.,English
Blast04_11,Blast04,11,11,0.0,"It's not a chasm, but it is noticeable.",English
Blast04_12,Blast04,12,36,0.175,"I have a few others that I'd say the Blast is comparable to, so again, it isn't like this one is bad, just not the best of what I own.",English
Blast04_13,Blast04,13,43,0.166666666667,"There's a lot to like about this, and even despite the sound, I'd be tempted to use this over my Jam just for the Alexa, but the wireless is definitely an issue if that doesn't clear up",English
Blast05_0,Blast05,0,9,0.0,I have an echo dot and now this.,English
Blast05_1,Blast05,1,36,0.175,"I need to figure out how to name them different things because they both answer when I talk to them, meaning though this is a speaker, it's also a full on Alexa.",English

Blast05_3,Blast05,3,8,0.183333333333,"Good, above average for a peripheral.",English
Blast05_4,Blast05,4,8,0.4,It is very portable which is nice.,English
Blast05_5,Blast05,5,24,0.0,"It's not ""always on"" like Alexa, however, it has to be powered on after a period of inactivity.",English
Blast05_6,Blast05,6,18,1.0,The best thing about this from a portable speaker connoisseur (my son) is the VOLUME!,English
Blast05_7,Blast05,7,16,0.25,You can crank this thing up really loud and the sound doesn't get distorted.,English
Blast05_8,Blast05,8,25,-0.125,Where I get a bit tripped up is the price - I'm just not sure the quality is equal to the price point.,English
Blast05_9,Blast05,9,20,0.183333333333,"As an average user, I don't see how this is that much superior to a regular Echo.",English
Blast06_0,Blast06,0,13,-0.166666666667,So it took me less than 5 minutes to set this up.,English
Blast06_1,Blast06,1,16,0.25,Be sure to load the ultimate ears app on your phone to allow Alexa activation.,English

Blast07_0,Blast07,0,5,1.0,This thing is great!,English
Blast07_1,Blast07,1,27,0.0,We hooked it up in a matter of minutes via Bluetooth/wifi and had no issues pairing it with a Samsung phone and controlling it via Alexa.,English
Blast07_2,Blast07,2,30,0.329761904762,The big buttons on the side are a nice feature making it easy to control the volume manually and not fumble around looking for the right button to push.,English

Blast09_2,Blast09,2,8,0.0,I have added pictures to show why.,English
Blast09_3,Blast09,3,17,-0.35,It's design is not good at all for leaving sit out and remaining plugged in.,English

Blast14_3,Blast14,3,21,0.2,The speaker sounded very 'tinny' to me and there was no way I could find to change the tone.,English
Blast14_4,Blast14,4,35,0.225,"The same was true whether I used Bluetooth or Alexa (via WiFi), so I'm sure the sound quality was due to the speaker and not the music on my phone.",English
