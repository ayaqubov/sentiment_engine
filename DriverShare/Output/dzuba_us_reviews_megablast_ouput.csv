Megablast01_1,Megablast01,1,71,0.241702741703,"Whilst the sound is very impressive and better than many speakers at a similar price point, it is missing certain features from the megaboom such as the remote power on function (the ability to turn on the speaker with your phone), the ability to check battery status by holding the volume up and down buttons, and being able to ""join"" speakers for stereo.",English
