ID,Review
Megablast01,"""Smarter over time"", I really hope it is because there are quite a few bugs as of October 2017.
Whilst the sound is very impressive and better than many speakers at a similar price point, it is missing certain features from the megaboom such as the remote power on function (the ability to turn on the speaker with your phone), the ability to check battery status by holding the volume up and down buttons, and being able to ""join"" speakers for stereo.
This speaker does come with Amazon Alexa which I did not think that I would use but it has come in very useful as I can connect smart home products to it (and control via voice, eg lights) and switching songs when not using a phone.
However, at launch it only supports a couple of services including Amazon music, Spotify is not yet included but should be in the future.
One of the most annoying bugs that I have so far found is that when it is fully charged but plugged in, sometimes it will go into a boot loop where it will switch off, switch on and connect to devices before switching off again.
Another annoying thing I have found is that if you are playing music through Bluetooth and use Alexa for something, it will disconnect your phone.
Overall, I would recommend this speaker but I would suggest waiting until the software has been updated unless you are okay with bugs."
Megablast02,Alexa does not work unless you yell at it. Turns off when the base does not connect.
Megablast03,"I have had this only a couple of days; I am still learning its capabilities and quirks.
As the MEGABLAST was supposed to be back ordered for a couple of weeks, and I needed a portable speaker for a specific event I bought a BLAST last week and had used it for several days.
The MEGABLAST certainly has better sound quality and battery life than the BLAST.
They are easy to connect to most sources and I have enjoyed ALEXA for simple commands such as volume control. The bluetooth range is greater than I have ever experienced with other brands of speakers. I have used the speakers with iPhones, iPods, iPads, and a LG OLED television
.......however........
it will not connect properly to my iMac or MACmini. They will connect for a few seconds and then disconnect. No sound ever came from them. I contacted UE Support and they were not aware of this problem but will report it to the software designers.
It also appears that they did not include many features that were on the BOOM and MEGABOOM such as ""Block Party"", ""Multi Host"", and ""Speaker Phone"". I have given the MEGABLAST only 3 stars because of these missing features. I am hoping that UE will add them in future updates. I am returning the BLAST because of the lack of ""Block Party""

In summary, I recommend the MEGABLAST because of its excellent sound, range of bluetooth, and battery life. I would consider keeping the BLAST only because it is smaller and therefore more convenient to carry around"
Megablast04,"Buy the UE MEGABOOM instead of this MEGABLAST. This takes one single step forward by adding Amazon Alexa (which is still not as fully capable as a normal Amazon Echo) and about three to four steps backwards.

This gets loud and it sounds just ok. There is hardly any bass in it. The MEGABOOM on the other hand has great bass. The companion app has basically removed all the features/options that the MEGABOOM has. No equalizer, no PartyUp, no notification controls.

There is no way this is worth $300. I paid $300 for the MEGABOOM about two years ago and it's still going strong and sounds much better than this. I purchased this specifically for the PartyUp feature so I can stream music through it, my MEGABOOM, and my BOOM 2 all at the same time. No dice. There's absolutely no reason for this feature, and the many others, to be taken away.

The MEGABOOM is on sale right now for only $230 on UE's website! I'm returning this and buying another MEGABOOM to replace it. UE has really dropped the ball on this device."
Megablast05,"I just got this device in last week, did a firmware update, worked fine, charged overnight, and the bottom led next to the charging port stayed on and the whole device was unresponsive. Could not troubleshoot it with Logitech. Amazon is sending another one out today, will try again.

Pros:
Sound quality is truly amazing
Battery life I've heard awesome
Build quality is really great

Cons:
Can't use it as speakerphone.
Unless you have the $40 overpriced dock it's strange to charge on the bottom. Have to flip the device on its head while charging.
No Alexa ring to tell you it is hearing you, just have to trust it hears you and see it respond. Does fairly well at this.
No Aux out, why not?

Everyone seems to be saying the Megaboom is best bang for buck. It probably is. I'll be using mine at home the most so I like having Alexa built-in but it's a pretty hefty premium."
Megablast06,"I love You UE.. I've had the mini boom, the mobile boom, the boom, the roll, and currently a megaboom. I park it on the dash of my work truck and it belts out the tunes all day. For my needs, I really only need the good battery life and the battery indicator.. and of course the loud, over the engine noise, sound.
So I fired it up in the car only to find out I can't check the battery in the car.. need WiFi..the battery level isn't showing on my iphone. Can't even set it up without WiFi. Frustrating. Ok, I'll charge it up with my portable. Nope, the cord I use with my megaboom didn't fit on the Megablast. The area to plug into is a bit smaller. My car charger did work. Giddee Up.. it is loud, but a different loud. More high pitched...Not the deep rich full sound I'm used to with my megaboom. I really wanted to like this. The sacrifice is too much.. sound and battery life are the two needs at the top of my list. The ability to control It with my app is up there too. I need portability.. I don't need Alexa. After a side by side test I've decided to return the Megablast. After 30 minutes of the Megablast I turned it off.
I'll be waiting for your next WOW Ultimate Ears
Hoping to be wow'd"
Megablast07,"I have previously owned the UE Boom and am a big fan of their bluetooth speakers. When I heard about the UE Megablast, I wanted to get my hands on it. It is MUCH bigger than the Blast (see pic below next to the large jar of peanut butter) and so is the sound. It really fills the entire room! Caveat: If you listen to a lot of classical music or jazz, you may find the UE boom slightly too ""bass-y"". I occasionally enjoy classical music but mainly listen to country, pop, and R&B. It features a 360* speaker although I would estimate more like 300* as the black band is pretty wide. Not a big deal at all but worth noting. I also LOVE the integrated Alexa feature. In fact, the UE has delegated the Echo that was in our kitchen (central location) to the bedroom. Once you listen to music on the Megablast, the Echo sounds flat! It is also waterproof although I have no plans of taking it for a swim. It's too bulky in my opinion to be really portable. Perfect for keeping poolside but not suitable as a hand held boom box. My UE speakers also came with the optional dock and I highly recommend buying it. Much simpler to simply place on the dock for charging vs fiddling with the USB cable. The software is great - I had no trouble syncing it with my iPhone. Finally, and this is a minor suggestion/criticism - I wish that it had a band of lights around the top or bottom that lit up when using Alexa - similar to Echo. The only part that lights up is a tiny band on top of the speakers which is hard to see from across the room. Again, very minor quibble thus no deduction"
Megablast08,"This is the ultimate gift for the holidays. The box looks great -- very colorful. I believe this unit is well-worth the cost. It is like having a very cool librarian who plays songs.

This isn't just a music speaker as I thought when I selected it. ""Alexa"" comes built in. This additional feature in my opinion is quite powerful and awesome. I suppose it is the other way around -- it appears that the voice-command and request fulfillment is not secondary at all. What I am trying to say is that both the music and the knowledge available from this little unit are pretty great in their own right. Together they are fun and I can see being quite hooked. But I am still going to need the Internet, right?:=).

My husband, who is usually quite critical had an cute impish grin when I got this up and running, seeing what it can do. It was worth a tiny bit more patience and effort. And looking back, it doesn't feel as if it was more difficult for me than setting up a pair of earbuds. A bit more complex due to more features, but that is it. Once I saw the indicator light telling me it was fully charged, then the app immediately accepted the bluetooth connection, after it had already been connected to Wi-Fi. Then we heard a happy sound come out of the speaker. I didn't even need to go into my settings in my iPhone 5S, which is just great.

Even though I have an older cell phone, it still works, because my latest operating system is more updated than required for this to be compatible.

I then requested music to play, and since I am using Amazon Music as my service, I merely needed to tag the words ""Amazon Music"" to the end of the string of verbal commands to request her to play from the great database of music. Without that command tagged on to the end, the Logitech Ultimate Ears Megablast Portable Wi-Fi Bluetooth Speaker is programmed to otherwise say when she doesn't know something, and in my case she played something else nice like Elton John. Nice. So since I wanted to play a 40-year-old album which she didn't have access to, ""Alexa"" needed me to mention a music service to draw from, which could have easily been iHeart Music, or any of the other compatible music services that are listed. And I am seeing that more music services will be made compatible with this unit in the future. I went with a service that I know doesn't have commercials. There is documentation that instructs you if you want another service.

So then it went kind of like this: ""Alexa""..."" (Then the light comes on...) ""Please play Genesis (full album name) on Amazon Music"". A moment later I was listening to my favorites from 40 some odd years ago. The ""drumbeat"" sound tells me that the unit is on or if it is off. It took a bit of practice asking in the right way for something, but I caught on pretty fast. I always dance a happy dance when something works out this well. I read some more instructions, and took it into my office to play while I was browsing my emails.

Then it went something like this: I'd ask, ""Alexa, who is the President of the United States, and how did he win?"", and other pointed questions as well to test her capacity. It worked out well really. Some questions will get an ""I don't know"" response , or I will be offered something related that happened in the news. It is great fun to try to confound a computer, and she is quite gracious. After I played around like that I asked for my weather, where the United States is located (borders, oceans, other adjacent countries), and other solid questions like, ""What is in the news today?"". Also, I can set a timer for whatever length of time I want. The responses I got were sometimes from Wikipedia, or Reuters if it was just information I wanted. It is amazing how much information this unit can access. Truly awesome.

Although ""Alexa"" cannot get too opinionated, she is always polite and educational. This is great fun for an info junkie like me. It reminded me of when I first learned to surf the Web for educational purposes. So, great music and brains as well.

This is waterproof to a degree. There is a nice video on this product page showing a pool party, and young people tossing the speaker around. This item is relatively lightweight so that is not too much of a stretch. It is small for a speaker with this much oomph. The bass is wonderful, as well as the treble, playing my favorite ""test music"" at a reasonable level. There is a certain song I play that tests the quality of a speaker well. I absolutely cannot play this at full volume. My neighbors... The highest volume is scary loud for me anyway.

The buttons are highly user-friendly, and highly visible and accessible for someone who cannot see well. The LED indicators are also very easy for me to see and to understand. It doesn't get much simpler than to have a rather large, but unobtrusive plus and minus sign, easy-to-press for the volume. The other controls are at the top. Also easy. Powering on and off takes hardly any time.

The charging dock is quite nice. I didn't know I was getting it. It came in the same box, but packed separately, with its own little pamphlet, and a little ring to screw in so that the power from the charger will connect with the speaker. I saved a little part that closes this connection at first. I can use it while in transit - while I am traveling with it -- I suppose it is protection. I recommend getting both these items as a set, since it is also being offered without the charging dock. It just makes sense to me to pay a few dollars more, so later if I want it I am not putting out more money. That is just how my mind works. You be the judge.

I did check the button in the app, asking if it is ok that my data goes into a cloud server. That is a personal call I made in good conscience, knowing all I know about this matter.

I am so looking forward to learning more about Alexa, and hearing my favorite music in the background while I am multitasking on my computer, as I am on there way too much as it is.

Great sound, sophisticated and brainy. Very noteworthy. Yes please.

Enjoy."
Megablast09,"This speaker has a phenomenal look and feel, great features like waterproof/life-proof, and amazing sound quality. Also, this thing thing absolutely bumps- It gets so loud that playing anywhere near full volume would mean my neighbors could hear everything I'm listening to. The fact that this also has Alexa is a sweet cherry on top. It works perfectly with my smart lights, timers, weather, etc. and I've found myself using it it more often than my Echo Dot over the last few days due to the sound quality. Not having Spotify is the biggest con for me, but I got 3 months of free Amazon music unlimited within the set-up flow, so I can still play pretty much any song I want to hear. Can't wait to take this speaker out and about in the spring/summer months."
Megablast10,"I work at a retailer that sells this device, while i can vouch for the quality of the speaker and the amazing bass for the size. As for the sound for people that want multiple speakers this literally has the boom of a megaboom x2. Now for the upsetting part, of the 5 i have sold 3 of them have come back unable to work. tried the hard reset option to no avail, tried to get ahold of UE aka logitech to get support or help and they offer a warranty. as a retailer i want a fix otherwise how can isell a product where 1 out of every 2 i sell will probably come back bricked."
Megablast11,"TL;DR: World-class hardware and great Alexa functionlity hurt by clearly rushed software that makes Bluetooth usage awful.

I so want to like this smart speaker. The sound quality, when it's hooked up and working, is amazing, perhaps the best small speaker I've heard yet. Whatever tricks it's using for sound quality, it's like magic and fills large rooms in all directions with bass without compromising mid- and high-ranges. (Note: I have not yet heard the Apple HomePod. I imagine that is the main competition.)

When hooked up via WiFi to Alexa/Amazon, everything works as you'd expect similar to an Amazon Echo. There is one notable difference from the Echo, and that is Spotify, which is not supported over WiFi/Alexa. For this “smart speaker” functionality only, I'd rate it 4 out 5 stars. (Spotify support like the Echo, or adding Apple Music, Google Play Music, or Pandora would make me change my mind to 5 stars for WiFi/Alexa only.)

But when hooked up via Bluetooth, it's a bit of a bag of pain. For some reason, pairing is not quick and simple. Sometimes it just pairs like any other device, but sometimes it just doesn't show up as pairable making you try over and over until for some reason it works after multiple tries. After pairing, when it's turned on, it usually tries to re-connect to Bluetooth if previously connected when the Megablast was turned off. Usually. But sometimes it doesn't, which makes using it as a set-and-forget speaker impossible. You have to babysit connectivity. And, worst of all, if you ask Alexa something while listening to Bluetooth, it disconnects your Bluetooth source, lets you interact with Alexa, and leaves your Bluetooth disconnected afterwards.

Further, if you think “hey it'd be nice to use this with multiple Bluetooth connections like an ad-hoc speakerphone” the answer is “nope.” It can only connect with one Bluetooth device at a time. When it works.

For Bluetooth functionality only, I'd rate it 2 out 5 stars. (If it just worked, every time, like any other Bluetooth device and using Alexa did not disconnect Bluetooth connections, I'd rate 4 stars for Bluetooth only. If it further could do multiple Bluetooth connections, letting others use it ad-hoc for speakerphone calls, I'd rate 5 stars for Bluetooth only.)

Perhaps new firmware may solve these annoyances in the future? If so, I'll update my stars."
Megablast12,"I'm really impressed with this product. Paired with Amazon Music or another compatible music library, this device delivers high-quality music anywhere in or around your house that's within the range of your network. The sound quality is otherworldly, exceeding anything I've witnessed from a speaker this small. The bass absolutely booms, and I love how I can turn it up or down with a simple voice command, especially when running on my treadmill. With Alexa's voice-operated control software included, this one device will meet many of your household needs and be the centerpiece of your parties. The only negative I've experienced so far is the occasional need to repeat a voice command to Alexa, especially when there is background noise or the music is at high volume."
Megablast13,This is truly a magnificent speaker. It's extremely powerful with great base and booming sound. The claim is it's also waterproof although I haven't actually tested that. Amazon Alexa works perfectly on this device although it has some limitations. The main one I've found is that it doesn't play Spotify music. I'm going to assume at some point the software will be updated to support Spotify. All other uses for Alexa and just in general this speaker are working perfectly for me. The hardware itself is simply outstanding.
Megablast14,"FYI, I bought mine at BestBuy not Amazon.

I was hesitant on the on the sound part after reading reviews. So far mine has performed well. I love watching movies/shows on my iPad and tunneling the sound through the MegaBlast. and so far NO DELAYS! Also it is awesome how Alexa is built in.

I got this item because I wander from shower to woods to pick up truck bed napping to sea side catching. So far So good. well see how the ruggedness holds up in the snow."
Megablast15,"WOW!!!!!!!!!
I OWN THIS and we are HAPPY! From the moment you turn it on for that first BOOM sound, you know everything's changed. Easiest set up of many devices; just use your phone, get the app, activate Alexa and go. Radio stations go through TUNE IN and so far, lots of choices. lots of seroius bass and really, really loud. So, we began with, ""Alexa, play Johnny Mathis"" and then jumped to WGN radio. Yes, whatever you have will have that big, fat sound. Really the only limits in the Ultimate Ears is what you can't think of, so next, to a tv. Black, basic here; they make a bunch of color models that are gorgeous, but for conspicuous stelthing, black. 12 hour charge is accurate; get the (optional or might be bundled) charging pad! The pad makes it super easy to place and charge but pick up and take with.

Think Bose owns heavy sound? BULL! Megablast has the space advantage, as well as Alexa (have that already on a DOT, so if you've never tried it, do it on a Dot and then get the Megaboom: Alexa is essential for more than you know).

ITUNES: pair up, open prefs, find the megablast, choose it for output, might have to restart your laptop bu must restart itunes. Pretty spiffy!"
Megablast16,"Bought this to replace my Megaboom. Wish I would have waited a few months . The sound and build is indeed much better . However the overall experience is very lack lustre which is a shame . A lot of what made the Megaboom great, wasn't carried over feature and software wise . Not to say the features won't come with an update, but they definitely hurt the overall user experience right now.

Also the fact that they are charging $39 for a charging dock is just ludacris . For $300 it should be included . (I got it included as a promo)"
Megablast17,"NOTE: I've added a star to my original review, as the Customer Support comment below at least let me connect with bluetooth from my current Fire tablet. However, the app still didn't work from the Android phone, and the app available here on Amazon still isn't compatible with any Amazon devices.

So I can't control the speaker by it's built-in Alexa functionality, although I can now use the Alexa Functionality in my Fire tablet. However, that is not as convenient as if I could use the speaker function for that.

***

You have to connect through a phone or tablet to set the thing up.

For ios, it needs 10.2+. I have an iPhone 4s, which tops out at 9.x. So that's out.

I have two Fire tablets. On of them is the brand new 10"" tablet released this year. The app shows that neither of them are compatible. How do you put an app on Amazon that isn't compatible with any Amazon devices? That's insanely dumb.

Finally, as a last resort, I checked my wife's Zenphone. Andriod 5! I go to Google Play, find the app, and install it.

We're in business, right?

Wrong. Even though the phone's bluetooth sees the speaker and connects to it, the app pretends it doesn't exist at all.

Very frustrating.

For the speaker itself, once I was able to connect just through normal bluetooth I was able to check out it's performance. To be short, it was OK, but I was not seriously impressed.

High ranges and some vocals have some distortion. On the vocals, that means some voices sound raspy that should not sound raspy. For the high range sound, it is at times tinny sounding. The bass is decent, but not as good as at least one other bluetooth speaker I own.

Overall, I prefer my Jabra Solemate, which costs about a third of the current price of this Megablast speaker. So ask yourself, do you want to spend an extra couple of hundred bucks to maybe, if you're lucky, get to use Alexa? The Amazon Echo is less expensive and probably has similar to better sound quality, and you don't have any issues setting it up."
Megablast18,"STAY AWAY!! The only way to play more than one speaker is through Wi-Fi, and the only source that will play through Wi-Fi is. . . wait for it. . . Amazon! What a crock! Obviously UE cut some deal with amazon to get Alexa working, but the price apparently is that UE abandoned the ability to play multiple speakers with anything other than Amazon. Of course, this is nowhere disclosed in the marketing crap.

So if you want to use more than one speaker at a time, you can't use iTunes, Spotify, Apple Music, local content - just amazon prime."
Megablast19,"I was worried the speakers wouldn't be loud enough for my party. So wrong I was, these speakers rocked my house party and got the neighbors knocking on my door."
Megablast20,Long battery life. Does everything I need and is waterproof as well. Would recommend if anyone wants voice controlled music with great quality sound.
Megablast21,"My friend gave me this as a present, and I love it. It sounds great, the Alexa integration is awesome (I can turn my lights on and off with it!), and the fact that's portable and super durable means my toddler can play with it without me having to worry. I definitely recommend this for every household."
Megablast22,So loud!!! The Alexa integration is all this needed to be the best speaker on the market. Love it!
Megablast23,I'd give it better than a 5 star if i could. This speaker is AWESOME. Alexa is so cool. Amazing what you can do with this speaker. I DEFINITELY recommend buying
Megablast24,"Speaker gets loud and very crisp. Compared to the Megaboom, it is louder and delivers better bass. The bluetooth range is amazing, the unit is waterproof and shockproof. I use the speaker in home and on the go, have taken it to BBQs and the beach with the long lasting battery."
Megablast25,"Really awesome speaker! Sounds even better than my Megaboom, and it has the added perk of Alexa. Love the virtual in-destructiveness of this speaker. My one complaint is that the speaker doesn't have Spotify yet, but the set-up and free 3 months of Amazon Music was seamless, and I haven't missed Spotify yet"
Megablast26,"The software cripple an otherwise magnificent piece of hardware. My biggest current frustrations- the speaker will not connect via bluetooth to my MacBook or MacBook Pro, pairing with other UE devices is not supported (""Block Party""), and Alexa does not support Spotify. I'm a huge fan of previous UE products I've owned, and if/when the software is updated to be AT LEAST on par with UE BOOM series, it will deserve 5 stars."
Megablast27,Great sound. Terrible battery life. Alexa is not very useful.
