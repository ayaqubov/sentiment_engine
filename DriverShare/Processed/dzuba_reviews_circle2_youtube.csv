UgyBy0iubNWaGLEsiFt4AaABAg,"Thanks for the review. Was quite interested in this, but the monthly payment and having to rely on their online service for it to be of any use is completely horrible and a total dealbreaker.

Would never consider it now that I know that's the case. While it might work well in short-term, I'm not happy to pay for such a high price for something that's future is completely uncertain and relying on their online service - aswell as my online functionality."
UgyydhSE6g01pxzkS5h4AaABAg,Bitch is failed
Ugw-lNQqJgqrx9V-TA94AaABAg,Fuck logitech
UgwCl5lwRqLGekKSKpx4AaABAg,So which camera would you recommend with the SD and doesn't need third party cloud??  Thank you!!!
Ugzhp0WatEmJ-nPWARp4AaABAg,"I had a different experience with my Circle 2.  When watching ""LIVE"" on my iPhone, the video was clear and well lit.  When playing back mid-day recorded motion, almost all videos were nearly full black, as if it were midnight without any lights turned on.  Sometimes I could see a shadow of the person walking past the camera. I borrowed a used Logitech Circle 1 and put it in the same locations in my home and pointed in the same direction and all recorded videos played back perfectly.  I am returning my Circle 2 today and will buy 3 of the Circle 1 cameras that are now well discounted.Your review missed an important feature of the Logitech Circle cloud storage.  They also offer 14 days of stored recordings for $3.99 per month per camera.   That is a significant improvement over previous rates.  Now I can justify the expense of multiple cameras.You also noted that the Circle 2 requires a few seconds to wake up from low power mode.  Mine took about a minute or two, which is probably only annoying when I was trying to show off my new camera."
UgwO3wabL2JLKlaAhBN4AaABAg,"Needs opinions; this, or the arlo pro???"
Ugz4Bj2qRVR3KsNyUX14AaABAg,"Hey if you plug the wireless version of the camera into a solar powered power bank, would that allow it to work without having to bring it in for charging?"

UgxEnkn8KrOJHlyXtgV4AaABAg,"Its not recording 1080p, it's doing 720p and there is no way to change it to 1080p! Any suggestions?"

UgyMvHgmDaAgZ6J_5gx4AaABAg,"1...it doesn't last 3 months. More like 10% a day. 
2)  wake up time to view live view takes for ever! 
3) can't change the settings... 
I would wait a while til they fix all that. Returned my wireless to a wired one."
UgzIqmy3zJRpb5JiS1F4AaABAg,That background music is very annoying.

Ugzntz3MwSoxHTNSFal4AaABAg,"At last, it's released. Thanks for the swift review.

Can more than one motion detection zone be set up? Also, this should just work with HomeKit?"

UgxoKGONSUSFYfVXidV4AaABAg,"I've been waiting for these to come out. Now I see there's no SD card slot, Ill look elsewhere. Poor Logitech, they suffer from a bad case of mediocrity."

Ugg0c87DgWc0cXgCoAEC,What would you recommend for a camera with storage?  Logitech has missed the boat again with this one!
,
,
Ughd03-wBLDYmXgCoAEC,"2 videos in 1 day, impressive! 

So does this not have the option to use physical storage like a Micro SD?"
