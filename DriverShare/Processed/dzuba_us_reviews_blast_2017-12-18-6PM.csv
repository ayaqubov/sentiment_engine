Blast01,"I had been looking to get into the speak-your-command speaker game for a while but was unsure of what I would like to go with but ultimately when the opportunity came to get the UE Blast with Alexa I jumped at the chance. While I had some experience with issuing commands to my Xbox I knew the experience of using Alexa was much better since I had set them up as gifts for relatives in the past. When I received the UE Blast it was nearly fully charged and had minimal packaging. It was ready to go out of the box but I did have to download and configure the app which was pretty easy. After linking it to my account on Amazon and establishing a bluetooth and wifi connection I was ready to test it out.

The speaker itself is quite similar in design to another speaker that my wife and I had been using for a couple of years now, that is the UE Boom. It's bigger and has better sound. I knew that our experience with the UE Boom had been a positive one, the speaker held a charge a long time, was easy to pair and had excellent sound so I held high hopes for the UE Blast. Once everything was configured the UE Blast was very easy to use by issuing Alexa commands. The toughest part is remembering the best way to address the commands, although it should be noted that Alexa doesn't require rote, specific type of commands (as the Xbox does) but through practice my wife and I have found out that it does respond to certain phrasings better than others. You also have to learn to add a slight pause after saying ""Alexa"" and not just start yelling out commands but that becomes second nature in practice.

I was highly disappointed to see that Alexa could not control Spotify and that Spotify would only work when using a Bluetooth command, similar in nature to the UE Boom. Spotify is my primary music source and I do not like that Amazon seems to want to steer you to their Amazon Prime Music direction. However, it should be noted that you do not have to be a subscriber to the Amazon music service to use Alexa on this device, but it will open up more music, including your own if you have a subscription to it.

I have used the speaker twice now in long sessions and the first session I got about 7 hours out of moderate listening levels which was, in my opinion, disappointing considering the speaker promises ""up to 12 hours"". We all know ""up to"" is the key there but still, roughly half of the promised amount is not what I'd consider a home run. The second time listening from a full charge we got roughly 9 hours and that is listening at moderate listening levels so that was a bit better. It honestly made me wonder if the first I was not at a complete charge. It should be noted here that the only way to know the charge level of the speaker is through the app and you will only know two levels of charge, full charge or partial charge and that is a sincere lack of information in my opinion that needs updated with a future fix for the app.

The quality of the sound of the speaker is very high for a large room and the speaker will fill the room with sound. Any larger than a large room though and the speaker will struggle but for most people volume or clarity of the music will not be any issue whatsoever. It was disappointing that I was unable to band my UE Blast to my UE Boom to create a stereo, or mirror, effect from one source. I worked on this for well over an hour before looking online and determining it simply is not possible.

So word to the wise, if you already own a UE product and are considering buying this to add on as a ""stereo"" effect or even just a multi-room, one source solution you will be out of luck. It remains to be seen if this will be fixed in a future update but I sincerely doubt that it will happen based upon my research.

Ultimately I do recommend this device, it's very clear, very loud, integrates Alexa commands perfectly and has decent battery life. Just be aware though that it won't control Spotify via Alexa, the battery life is not what is promised (but still good overall) and it will not pair with another UE device.
Another downside of course is the price. I am not completely sure this is a great value for most people but I will say if you have the money the device will not disappoint. For most people on a budget this would be a better value purchase on sale or at a discounted rate perhaps on Black Friday. There are certainly more reasonably priced devices that will do many of what this speaker offers. But if you want a great all-in-one solution, are aware of some of the limitations of the device and its app and are willing to pay the money you cannot beat the UE Blast."
Blast02,"Just got my blast today and I love it so far. Connecting it to the Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Alexa were all super easy through the App. The sound quality is excellent and Wi-FI/Bluetooth range is great. The one negative thing that I've noticed is that you can no longer turn it on using the App which you can do on the Boom 2. Hopefully that will be an added feature in a future update."
Blast03,"Although there may be a way to set ""Alexa"" up with the older Boom and Mega Boom apps that you have on your phone or tablet; don't try. START by finding the Ultimate Ears BLUE SQUARE app in your app store. If you have difficulty ""updating"" the speaker, try a sleepy hour. Works well then. Seems the UE server has been overwhelmed.

I have found 2 snags so far that make it not like a ""Fancy ECHO""--

1) You have to tap to wake Alexa up after a time out period, like a night's sleep. You just cant say, ""Alexa what time is it?""

2) It seems Sirius XM is not supported. I even deleted the link association from my Echo and reconnected and it can't be picked up. HOWEVER I still can link it with the BLAST through Bluetooth and my phone. Just no ""Alexa, play Sirius XM""
voice control. After you Bluetooth in you have to remember to cut the Bluetooth connection to get Alexa back"
Blast04,"Ears is a mixed bag in comparison to similar items

Pros:
Highly portable: it's light and easy to carry in the hand, has a small footprint

Easy set-up: It paired easily with my iPhone, and setting up the wi-fi connection and then the connection to my Amazon account was quick and painless. Took no more than a minute or two

Alexa: This is my only Alexa device, so I can't say how it does in comparison to others, but it's so far been mostly (more on that in the cons) a good experience. It's responsive, and rarely requires a repeat of any given command so long as I'm within about 10 feet. Farther than that and I need to really speak up and occasionally repeat myself, but only once typically, not four or five times

Waterproof: I confess I haven't tested this, so I'm just going with the product description, but it's a nice feature to have for such a portable speaker

Cons
Wi-fi connectivity: While set-up was a breeze, I've had several issue with it momentarily dropping wi-fi. The first time I listened for half an hour and it dropped wi-fi once. The second time, it dropped wi-fi repeatedly, not once getting through an entire song in about 20-30 minutes of listening. The third time, also about half an hour, fell somewhere in the middle, dropping wi-fi three times. It's a momentary drop--about a 2-3 second pause, but it's sure an annoying one. If things change I'll update, but if this stays an issue I'll certainly not be using this even though I like the Alexa aspect

Sound: I'd put this somewhere between Pro and Con. It's not bad sound at all, but it's a little thin. I also have a Jam Heavy Metal and the sound on that is definitely richer and more full. It's not a chasm, but it is noticeable. I have a few others that I'd say the Blast is comparable to, so again, it isn't like this one is bad, just not the best of what I own.

There's a lot to like about this, and even despite the sound, I'd be tempted to use this over my Jam just for the Alexa, but the wireless is definitely an issue if that doesn't clear up"
Blast05,"I have an echo dot and now this. I need to figure out how to name them different things because they both answer when I talk to them, meaning though this is a speaker, it's also a full on Alexa.

The sound quality is decent. Good, above average for a peripheral. It is very portable which is nice. It's not ""always on"" like Alexa, however, it has to be powered on after a period of inactivity.

The best thing about this from a portable speaker connoisseur (my son) is the VOLUME! You can crank this thing up really loud and the sound doesn't get distorted.

Where I get a bit tripped up is the price - I'm just not sure the quality is equal to the price point. As an average user, I don't see how this is that much superior to a regular Echo."
Blast06,So it took me less than 5 minutes to set this up. Be sure to load the ultimate ears app on your phone to allow Alexa activation. The sound is solid and robust as any single portable speaker I have ever had. A healthy bass. The Alexa feature works perfectly. The battery seems to last as advertised. The device is attractive and heavy enough to be solid without being ungainly.
Blast07,"This thing is great! We hooked it up in a matter of minutes via Bluetooth/wifi and had no issues pairing it with a Samsung phone and controlling it via Alexa. The big buttons on the side are a nice feature making it easy to control the volume manually and not fumble around looking for the right button to push. We've been getting lots of use out of it, so, it makes for a nice addition to the house. Sounds great too!"
Blast08,"Love it so far, it was easy to set up and does all that Alexa does so far except make phone calls and send messages. It DOES hook up to my sirious XM account through Alexa, as one reviewer said it does not. We just had to connect our Account through the Alexa App and now it is all set with sirious xm. Will update review if anything changes."
Blast09,"Easy setup, great sound, perfect portable speaker. So why only 4 stars? I have added pictures to show why. It's design is not good at all for leaving sit out and remaining plugged in. The design is actually really stupid when it comes to that.

I almost gave 3 stars for the overall design, but the name of the device does include portable. I was hoping to leave this plugged in in the Kitchen for my wife to use until we take it outside, but I don't think that is going to be happening. I think I just lost my dot."
Blast10,"I used to use the UE Boom all the time and got this one as a gift. I love it. I use Alexa way more than I thought I would - turn music up/down, set a timer, adding to my Amazon cart, etc. Makes life easier. I LOVE THIS!!"
Blast11,"Beware: I have been using a Amazon Echo Dot for over a year...5 stars. I bought the Blast because of its portability with the built-in battery, plus it has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The Blast's Wi-Fi receiver is lousy compared to the Amazon Dot. Sitting next to each other the Dot does not drop the signal...the Blast is regularly dropping the signal. Using the Dot, from across the room I can tell Alexa what to do. With the Blast you have to scream, or stand over it to give Alexa the commands. And, many times you have to repeat the command 3 or 4 times before something happens. The Blast's box is very difficult to open. I actually had to tear it apart to get to the unit. If the box was in better shape I would be returning it to Amazon. So I am forced to keep it."
Blast12,"Great sounding speaker, durable and waterproof. Lacks some bass but mids/highs sound excellent."
Blast13,Great speaker. Love the sound.
Blast14,"Ordered because this was the only battery-powered WiFi-enabled, bluetooth speakers I could find. A friend has a UE Boom that sounds great, so I assumed this would have similar sound--and WiFi!
Unfortunately, while the features are pretty cool, the sound leaves a lot to be desired. The speaker sounded very 'tinny' to me and there was no way I could find to change the tone. The same was true whether I used Bluetooth or Alexa (via WiFi), so I'm sure the sound quality was due to the speaker and not the music on my phone.
Returning this speaker today and keeping an eye out for a better sounding WiFi Speaker"
Blast15,Portable wireless speaker that blast a big sound. Perfect for small get together indoors or out. I haven't used the Alexa feature so can't comment on that. What I can say is it's easy to set up and use for all the other features.
Blast16,DONOT BUY. If you are lucky and connect to Amazon great. I just spent 1 hour with UE and everything is connected up Alexa they told me to call Amazon and get it connected to device. Called Amazon and I spent 1 hour with Amazon. 45 with supervisor explaining that Alexa inside finally he had to go UE Blast website. Then still not agreeing so i had him look it up on Amazon. Finally agreeing that is in it. 15 minutes him telling me that he cannot help me.
Blast17,"i love my UE booms, and i use the feature double up and party up all of the time, pretty upset that this model doesn't have it and i will not be purchasing another UE product until it is included again"
Blast18,I don't want to look some Christian zealot. No way would I tout a speaker with a big Christian Cross on it!
